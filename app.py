      - Im currently 20 years old, 21 in december! Im studying semi-full time at victoria university of wellington
        and I have been living in wellington for the past 20 years.
        
      - I enjoy video games, programming and camping out on the tararua and rimutaka mountain ranges or exploring new tracks with my friends.
      
      - I spent a year at a polytechnic learning eletrical engineering up to level 3 and used my qualification to get out into the industry 
      where I found my allergys were far too overwhelming. After leaving the trades I took up driving and worked part time to deliver large amounts of catering food to clients,
      i worked there for about a year before I finally decided to dedcate myself to my education.
